nRF7002dk-UART
###########

Basic firmware that demonstrates UART TX and RX using nRF7002DK (TX Pin: P1.01; RX Pin: P1.00).

This has been tested with an nRF9160DK running `this firmware <https://github.com/Michaelszeng/nRF9160DK_UART/tree/master>`_, where the DK's are wired `like so <https://github.com/Michaelszeng/nRF7002dk-UART/blob/master/nRF9160DK_nRF7002DK.jpg>`_ (ignore the LED strip that is also wired to the nRF7002DK).

This has been tested using two nRF7002DK's (both running this firmware) wired `like so <https://github.com/Michaelszeng/nRF7002dk-UART/blob/master/nRF7002DKs.jpg>`_.
